                  The problem was the original Carbon Footprint Calculator had poor UI/UX, complicated navigation, outdated design, inadequate information, and limited functionality.

                  <br />
                  This resulted in user frustration, confusion, and incorrect carbon footprint calculations. The client was not satisfied with the application's performance and wanted a redesign to improve its interface, user experience, and overall design, while aligning with the client's branding.

                <p>
                  The design process for redesigning the Tuco2 application began with research and analysis, which would involve conducting user research to identify the target audience, their needs, pain points, and goals, as well as analyzing the competition to understand best practices and industry standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on the research and analysis, the design and prototyping phase would involve creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to develop the new user interface and user experience. These designs would be tested with users to ensure usability and accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the design and prototyping phase, the implementation and testing phase would begin. This would involve developing the application using the chosen technology and testing the application to ensure functionality, usability, and accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Feedback and refinement would be an ongoing process throughout the design process. Feedback from users and stakeholders would be collected and analyzed, and necessary changes would be made to improve the application's performance and usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, after the application is launched, post-launch support and maintenance would be provided to ensure its continued success. This would include bug fixes, updates, and improvements based on user feedback and changing industry standards.
